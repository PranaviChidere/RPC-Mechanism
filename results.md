This work extends a Python-based RPC framework to support object marshalling using a StudentProfile. The server validates incoming data types using validate_types() before processing requests, ensuring type safety and preventing invalid inputs. Upon successful validation, the server computes and returns the average of student grades. This demonstrates secure and reliable remote procedure execution.
